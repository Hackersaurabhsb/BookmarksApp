<!-- Make sure that no template tag is split into multiple lines; Django doesnâ€™t support multiple-line tags.
The dashboard now displays the total number of images bookmarked by the user. We have added a
with template tag to create a variable with the total number of images bookmarked by the current 
user. We have included a link with an href attribute that contains the bookmarklet launcher script. 
This JavaScript code is loaded from the bookmarklet_launcher.js template. -->
